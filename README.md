# Showcase
This is the repository where I will put a bunch of smaller projects I am working on, including some of the [Hackclub](https://workshops.hackclub.com/) workshops I complete!

## How to see it?
To see this run, run the program `python3 -m http.server`

Then navigate to `localhost:8000` to see it run!
